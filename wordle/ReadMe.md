# Wordle Solver

Install GitHub Desktop, Virtual Studio Code, and npm (if necessary)
Do Steps 1 and 2 only once since files should be compiled in the same folder.
1. Press the green "<> Code" button and then press open with Github Desktop
2. Clone the repository and open it on Virtual Studio Code.
3. On the left hand side you should see files of the Wordle Solver along with Outline, Timeline, and NPM Script.
4. Press NPM Script -> Install -> Start and you should get a link with a local host like "http://localhost:3000"

You should get this message:

"Compiled successfully!

You can now view wsol in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000

5. Tap on the link (local or on your network) and you should see the website.
